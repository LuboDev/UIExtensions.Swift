# UIExtensions

GUI Extensions and helpers.

## Requirements

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions,
visit their website. To integrate UIExtensions into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'UIExtensions.Swift'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code
and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but UIExtensions does support its use on
supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding UIExtensions as a dependency is as easy as adding it to
the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/horizontalsystems/UIExtensions.Swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```
